## Installation

### Backend

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git](https://github.com/Chandan-Choubey/Authentication-in-express)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository/backend
   ```

3. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster:**

   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - Sign up or log in to your MongoDB Atlas account.
   - Create a new project:
     - Click on "Projects" in the left sidebar.
     - Click on "Create New Project" and follow the prompts.
   - Build a new cluster:
     - In your project, click on "Build a Cluster."
     - Select your preferred configuration (cloud provider, region, cluster tier).
     - Click "Create Cluster" and wait for the cluster to be provisioned.
   - Create a new database user:
     - Go to the "Database Access" tab in your project.
     - Click "Add New Database User."
     - Enter a username and password.
     - Assign necessary roles and click "Add User."
   - Whitelist your IP address:
     - Go to the "Network Access" tab in your project.
     - Click "Add IP Address."
     - You can add your current IP address or use `0.0.0.0/0` for access from any IP address (less secure).
     - Click "Confirm."

4. **Get the MongoDB connection string:**

   - Go to your cluster and click on "Connect."
   - Choose "Connect your application."
   - Copy the connection string provided. It will look something like this:

     ```
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

5. **Create a `.env` file:**

   - Copy the contents of `.env.sample` to a new `.env` file in the backend directory.
   - Update the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string and any other environment variables.

     Example `.env` file:

     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     PORT=8000
     ```

6. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

7. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository/frontend
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

   - Copy the contents of `.env.sample` to a new `.env` file in the frontend directory.
   - Update the `.env` file with any necessary environment variables.

     Example `.env` file:

     ```env
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
     ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
